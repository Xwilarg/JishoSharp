## JishoSharp
A C# library to get information about japanese words using jisho.org

There are 2 ways to search for information:

### Kanji search (WIP)
Get information about a kanji

### Word search
Use the static function SearchClient.SearchWordAsync.<br/>
Basically it does what the official Jisho API does, for more information please check [the wiki](https://github.com/Xwilarg/JishoSharp/wiki/Word-Search).

### Advanced word search (WIP)
Provide what the wiki doesn't provide:
 - Examples
 - Audio
